    {
      question: "Can I use a steam cleaner on all floor types?",
      answer: "While steam cleaners work great on hard surfaces like tile, laminate, and sealed hardwood, they should not be used on unsealed wood floors, as the moisture can damage the wood. Always check your floor manufacturer's recommendations before steam cleaning."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I clean the steam cleaner?",
      answer: "It's recommended to clean your steam cleaner after each use. Empty the water tank, clean the cleaning pads, and allow the machine to dry completely. This prevents mold growth and ensures optimal performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do steam cleaners really kill germs?",
      answer: "Yes, steam cleaners can kill up to 99.9% of bacteria and germs when used at the proper temperature (typically 212°F/100°C). The high heat effectively sanitizes surfaces without chemicals."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I add cleaning solutions to the water?",
      answer: "Most steam cleaners are designed to work with water only. Adding cleaning solutions can damage the machine and void the warranty. The steam itself is effective at cleaning and sanitizing."
    },
    {
